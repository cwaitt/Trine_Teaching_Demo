# pH -- A measure of Acidity

Ways we typically measure the quantity or amount of *things* is mass, moles, atoms, and concentration. When working with acids and bases, the concentrations of H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> are frequently very small numbers and therefore inconvientient to work with. A more practical measure of acidity (and alkalinity) is called **pH**. The **pH** of a solution is defined as the *negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion activity*:

$$ \text{pH} = -\log([\text{H}^{+}]) $$

or 

$$ \text{pH} = -\log([\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{+}]) $$

\[H<sup>+</sup>\] and \[H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>\] is understood to be the numerical value of the hydrogen or hydronium concentration in mol L<sup>-1</sup>. When calculating the pH of a solution, we traditionally drop the units. The equation above is simpliy designed to give a convient number to work with. The negative logaritm gives us a positive number for pH. Like the equilibrium constant, the pH of a silution is a dimensionless quantity.
