# pH -- A measure of Acidity

Ways we typically measure the quantity or amount of *things* is mass, moles, atoms, and concentration. When working with acids and bases, the concentrations of H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> are frequently very small numbers and therefore inconvientient to work with. A more practical measure of acidity (and alkalinity) is called **pH**. The **pH** of a solution is defined as the *negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion activity*:

$$ \text{pH} = -\log([\text{H}^{+}]) \text{ or } \text{pH} = -\log([\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{+}]) $$
