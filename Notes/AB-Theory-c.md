# Acid Base Theories

There are a handful of ways one can define if a compound acts like an acid or base. This page will cover the three main acid-base theories that are commonly iscussed in chemistry (but acknolwedge that there are others).

## Arrhenius Theory

The Arrhenius definition is relatively straight forward but only apply to aqueous solutions. <ins> **Acids** are substances that yeild H$^{+}$ ions when disolved in water, and **bases** yeild OH$^{-}$ ions.</ins> Lets look at a couple of examples.

$$$ HCl\text{(aq)} \rightarrow H^{+} + Cl^{-}$$$
