# Acid Base Theories

There are a handful of ways one can define if a compound acts like an acid or base. This page will cover the three main acid-base theories that are commonly iscussed in chemistry (but acknolwedge that there are others).

## Arrhenius Theory

The Arrhenius definition is relatively straight forward but only apply to aqueous solutions. **Acids** are substances that yeild H<sup>+</sup> ions when disolved in water, and **bases** yeild OH<sup>-</sup> ions. Lets look at a couple of examples.

$$ \text{HCl(aq)} \rightarrow \text{H}^{+}\text{(aq)} + \text{Cl}^{-}\text{(aq)} $$

HCl(aq) is considered an Arrhenius acid because when dissolved into water, HCl dissociates into H<sup>+</sup>(aq) and Cl<sup>-</sup>(aq) ions.

$$ \text{NaOH(aq)} \rightarrow \text{Na}^{+}\text{(aq)} + \text{OH}^{-}\text{(aq)} $$

NaOH(aq) is considered an Arrhenius base because when dissolved into water, NaOH dissociates into Na<sup>+</sup>(aq) and OH<sup>-</sup>(aq) ions.

### Exercise
Circle if the compound in the table is an Arrhenius Acid or Base.
