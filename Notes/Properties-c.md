# Properties of Acids and Bases

There are numerous example of acid-base chemistry in everyday life. Below you'll find a small table of applications and example of where you might observe acid-base chemistry, along with links to some useful information.

| Application                  | [Examples](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Chemistry_for_Changing_Times_(Hill_and_McCreary)/07%3A_Acids_and_Bases/7.08%3A_Acids_and_Bases_in_Industry_and_in_Daily_Life)              |
| ---------------------------  | --------------------- |
| Household Cleaning Products  | Bleach, Vinegar, Soap |
| Cooking and Food Preparation | Baking Soda, Lemon Juice |
| Medicine                     | Antacids, Antibiotics, Diagnostic Testing |
| Soil and Agriculture         | Lime, Acid Rain, Fertilizer |

The presences of acids and bases (also called *alkalis*) has been known even before chemistry was established as field of science. During the time of the ancient Greeks, properties of acids and bases were vaguely understod, however, they realized that there were some fundemental differences between these substances.

| Property | Acid | Base |
| -------- | ---- | ---- |
| Taste    | Sour | Bitter |
| Touch    | Corrosive | Slippery |
| *pH*       | Below 7 | Above 7 |
| Reaction with Metal | Produce H<sub>2</sub>$ gas | Unreactive |
| Litmus Test | Turns Litmus paper red | Turns Litmus paper blue |

Acids and bases also share some unique properties such as: colorless, electrical conductivity, and reactive with indicators (changing their color). It wasn't until 1884 when Swedish chemist, Svante Arrhenius, provided a groundbreaking explanation for the categorization and behavior of acids and bases in aqueous solutions.
