# General Chemistry 1000

This repository is a model for a "learning management system" for a ficticeous general chemistry class. This repository contains folders for various topics. The only folder that contains content is the Acid-Base Chemistry Section. 

Go to the following sections for the lecture notes:

[Quantum Theory and the Subatomic World](./README.md)

[Many-Electron Atoms and the Periodic Table](./README.md)

[The Chemical Bond](./README.md)

[Molecular Structure and Interaction](./README.md)

[The States of Matter](./README.md)

[Thermochemistry](./README.md)

[Physical Equilibrium](./README.md)

[Chemical Equilibrium](./README.md)

[Acids and Bases](./Acids_and_Bases/)
