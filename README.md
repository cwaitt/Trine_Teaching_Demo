# Acid-Base Chemistry

This repository contains notes to refer to our lessons on Acid-Base chemistry. In this section, we will cover the basic concepts of acid-base chemistry such as: What are the physical and chemical properties of acids and bases? How do we define whats an acid and whats a base? What are the products of mixing acids and bases? and How do we measure the strength of an acid or base.
